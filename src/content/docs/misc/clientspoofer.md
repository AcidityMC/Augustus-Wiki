ClientSpoofer is used to Spoof the Client Info sent to the Server. As an Example meaning that if you join with Vanilla,Forge,Fabric or Lunar Client Servers can report that information about your Client to the AntiCheat and Admins of that Server. Using Spoofer goes around that reporting by telling the Server that you use a diffrent Client then you actually use

<div style="border-left: 3px solid #EEBD53; background-color: #5C4C29; padding: 10px 15px; color: #F4E6C5; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0px 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 1px;">
    <span style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">&#9888;</span>
    <span>Caution</span>
  </div>
