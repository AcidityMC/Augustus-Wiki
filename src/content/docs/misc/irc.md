IRC is an Augustus build in System that lets you see other Augustus Users on the Server

## Your visibility
Lets you set if other can see you are using Augustus or just your friends that you added over Augustus

## IRC-Formating
Lets you choose diffrent formating Styles for the IRC Tag that appears next to a Augustus users name

Diffrent Modes and their pictures will follow soon when i figure out how to put images into this

## ClientFriends
ClientFriends enabled will make you ignore everey Augustus User that as IRC enabled

## YourFriendsOnly
Enabled will only ignore friends that you have added in Augustus. Disabled will ignore every Augustus User that has IRC enabled

## AutoUnFriend
Will auto unfriend every augustus user for the rest of the round as soon every non Augustus user is dead. This includes Augustus Users that have IRC disabled
