## MoveFix
TL;DR Movefix makes you not flag on Simulated Anticheats like Polar/Intave/Grim/Karhu for Simulation.

Movefix applies your player's yaw/horizontal rotation to minecraft's movement processor so your player movement is correct with simulation on Simulated Anticheats like Polar/Intave/Grim/Karhu.
(explanation might be changed in the future)
